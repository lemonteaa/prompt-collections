Don't worry, I'm here to help you understand the passage, and I'll do my best to explain things in a way that's easy to grasp.

Let's take a closer look at the passage. Here's a selected section with some highlighted terms and phrases that I think are important:

<highlight>
I think what attracted me most to the scholars we now call *poststructural* is their very different description of human being. Of course, this is an ontological issue. Human being and being in general, was the linchpin of poststructuralism for me, and once I began to understand its very different subject, it was inevitable that preexisting social science research methodologies grounded in the Cartesian subject would fail. [Descartes (1637/1993) invented a human being who thinks and knows, a human being whose mind is separate from and superior to everything else (this is rationalism set in opposition to empiricism in epistemology), a human being who exists ahead of the world]{1}. I think, therefore I am. [Descartes’ ontology describes the world as some Other (Difference) that is out there separate from him (Same, Identity), which does not influence him]{2}. He is rational and self-contained (organized by internal relations) and moves through and is untouched by the outside that is not he: [Self/Other, Mind/Matter, Man/Nature]{3}.

The numbers in brackets refer to specific points that I think are worth exploring further. Let's start with the first one: {1}. The author is talking about Descartes' idea of the human being as a thinking, knowing entity that exists independently of the world. This is a key concept in philosophy, and it's interesting to see how the author reacts to it.

What would you like to know or discuss about this passage? Do you have any questions about the highlighted terms or phrases?

Oh yes, actually I'm a complete beginner and I have difficulty with even basic reading comprehension as there's so many alien words here, can you help?

----

Don't worry, I'm here to help you break down the passage and understand the unfamiliar terms.

Let's start with the first highlighted phrase: {1} "Descartes (1637/1993) invented a human being who thinks and knows, a human being whose mind is separate from and superior to everything else (this is rationalism set in opposition to empiricism in epistemology), a human being who exists ahead of the world."

Here are some key terms that might be unfamiliar:

* **Descartes**: René Descartes was a French philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 17th century. He's famous for his statement "I think, therefore I am."
* **Rationalism**: This is a philosophical idea that says knowledge comes from reason and thinking, rather than from experience or senses.
* **Empiricism**: This is a philosophical idea that says knowledge comes from experience and senses, rather than from reason or thinking.
* **Epistemology**: This is the study of knowledge and how we know things.
* **Ontology**: This is the study of existence and what it means to be.

In simple terms, the author is saying that Descartes had a particular idea about what it means to be human. He thought that humans are thinking, knowing beings whose minds are separate from the world around them. This idea is based on rationalism, which emphasizes the importance of reason and thinking.

Does that help clarify things? Are there any other terms or phrases that you're struggling with?

----

Oh I see, that's quite a lots of concepts, but your explanation and glossary is clear! I have some further phrases I don't understand: 1. "Human being and being in general, was the linchpin of poststructuralism for me" what is linchpin, and poststructuralism? 2. "organized by internal relations" um... object relation theory in psychology? 3. A bit embarassing, but what does "subject" and "object" mean here? I only know about that in English grammar lesson, seems to be something else here.

----

Don't be embarrassed! These are complex concepts, and it's great that you're asking questions.

**1. "Human being and being in general, was the linchpin of poststructuralism for me"**

* **Linchpin**: A linchpin is a term that comes from mechanics. It refers to a pin that holds together two or more parts of a machine. In a broader sense, a linchpin is a central or crucial element that holds something together. In this context, the author is saying that the concept of human being and being in general was the central idea that held together their understanding of poststructuralism.
* **Poststructuralism**: Poststructuralism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the mid-20th century. It's a bit tricky to define, but essentially, it's a reaction against traditional notions of structure, meaning, and knowledge. Poststructuralists argue that meaning is not fixed or stable, but rather it's constantly shifting and fragmented. They also challenge traditional notions of identity, power, and knowledge.

**2. "organized by internal relations"**

* This phrase doesn't directly relate to object relation theory in psychology, although it does touch on similar ideas. In this context, "internal relations" refers to the idea that the human being (or subject) is organized and defined by its internal relationships, rather than by external factors. Think of it like a self-contained system, where the relationships within the system define its structure and function.

**3. "Subject" and "Object"**

* In this context, "subject" and "object" don't refer to English grammar, but rather to philosophical concepts.
* **Subject**: In philosophy, the subject refers to the thinking, knowing, experiencing being (in this case, the human being). It's the entity that perceives, thinks, and experiences the world.
* **Object**: In philosophy, the object refers to the thing or entity that is perceived, thought about, or experienced by the subject. It's the external world, including other people, objects, and events.

In the context of Descartes' philosophy, the subject (the thinking being) is separate from the object (the external world). This separation is a key aspect of his philosophy, and it's what the author is critiquing.

Does that help clarify things?

----

I see I see! Can you give me some concrete example of subject vs object in the context above?

----

Here are some concrete examples to illustrate the subject-object distinction in the context of Descartes' philosophy:

**Example 1:**

* **Subject:** You, as a thinking being, looking at a tree.
* **Object:** The tree itself, as an external entity that you are perceiving.

In this example, you (the subject) are thinking about and perceiving the tree (the object). The tree is separate from you, and you are separate from the tree.

**Example 2:**

* **Subject:** A researcher studying a social phenomenon, such as poverty.
* **Object:** Poverty itself, as an external entity that the researcher is studying.

In this example, the researcher (the subject) is thinking about and studying poverty (the object). Poverty is separate from the researcher, and the researcher is trying to understand and analyze it as an external entity.

**Example 3:**

* **Subject:** You, as a thinking being, having a thought about your own emotions.
* **Object:** Your emotions themselves, as an external entity that you are thinking about.

In this example, you (the subject) are thinking about your own emotions (the object). Your emotions are separate from your thinking self, and you are trying to understand and analyze them as an external entity.

In each of these examples, the subject is the thinking, knowing being, and the object is the external entity that is being perceived, thought about, or studied. This distinction is central to Descartes' philosophy, and it's what the author is critiquing in the passage.

Does that help clarify the subject-object distinction?

----

Very interesting! It seems that the example you selected is deliberately chosen to highlight that an object can also be some thing normal people like me probably wouldn't have thought of as a candidate to be an object!

----

You're absolutely right, I chose those examples to illustrate that the concept of "object" in this context can be quite broad and might not always align with our everyday intuition.

In philosophy, especially in the context of Descartes' philosophy, the term "object" can refer to anything that is perceived, thought about, or studied by the subject. This can include physical objects, like trees or chairs, but also abstract concepts, like emotions, ideas, or even social phenomena like poverty.

By using examples like emotions or poverty as objects, I wanted to highlight that the subject-object distinction is not just limited to physical objects, but can also apply to more abstract or intangible entities.

This is an important aspect of philosophical inquiry, as it encourages us to think more critically about the nature of reality, knowledge, and our relationship with the world around us.

You're doing great, by the way! You're asking excellent questions and engaging with the material in a thoughtful way. Keep it up!

----

How about the third example you give? Isn't that something reflexive or recursive or self-referential? My brain's hurt lol...

----

Don't worry, your brain is just doing some excellent philosophical gymnastics!

Yes, the third example I gave is indeed a self-referential or reflexive example. When we think about our own emotions, we're essentially making our emotions the object of our thought. This creates a kind of loop where the subject (our thinking self) is thinking about its own emotions (the object), which are themselves a part of the subject.

This kind of self-referential thinking can be mind-bending, but it's a common theme in philosophy, especially in the areas of epistemology (the study of knowledge) and the philosophy of mind.

In this case, the example highlights the complex relationship between the subject and the object, and how they can become intertwined in self-referential thinking. It's a bit like trying to take a selfie while looking at the selfie – it creates a kind of infinite regress!

But don't worry if your brain hurts – it's just a sign that you're engaging with some really interesting and complex ideas!
