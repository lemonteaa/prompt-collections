# Science of LLM (Large Language Model)

## Perspective on what LLM is

- A "blind" next token predictor based on statistics?
- Compression of the internet
- Knowledge and reasoning engine
- A cognitive computer (natural language text is the primitive unit of data, and prompts are computer program/functions, that can be composed via prompt chaining)
- Massively multitask AI (the unsupervised training on internet scale dataset will incidentally include diverse tasks)

## Bitter lesson

- Brute force scaling works
- Two things particularly amenable to scaling: searching (via attention mechanism) and learning (eg in-context learning, aka learning-to-learn)

## Emergent property

- In-context learning: put examples in the prompt (i.e. context), and the LLM apparently perform better
- Hypothesis of mechanism: Bayesian interpolation vs meso-optimization
- Bayesian interpolation: it is simply interpolating among the things it has learnt before (so out-of-distribution it will perform badly, it's just that "out-of-distribution" means "not found in the entire internet" which can be harder than it appears)
- Meso-optimization: neural networks are universal function approximator, and it is theoretically possible that it learnt to emulate the machine learning algorithms, such as gradient descent (!)

# Prompt Engineering Technique

## Notes on prompt formatting

- By default, using markdown + latex. With `test` for inline code and triple backtick (with language marker) for programming codes.
- By default, use the OpenAI chat completion style. List of messages, each message has a role and text content. Role can be "system", "user", or "assistant". When we say prompt engineering, we are mostly referring to designing the initial system prompt. (Then the user message is the query)
- Few-shot prompt (see below) may use special formatting to "nudge" the AI into doing text completion. But with newer models it's not strictly necessary - just insert examples as data pair in your system prompt, and have a separate place for the user query later in another message is okay.

- For complex system prompt with components and module, you may use Anthropic style prompting - Use custom XML tag that's like semantic HTML. Example:

```md
<prompt>
You will perform the task <X> below...

<background_info>
Our company, Quickoo Inc., is a food tech startup...

Here are some company documents you may find useful:
<internal_docs>
  <internal_doc ref="HR manual">
Welcome! As our valued employee, I would like to remind you...
  </internal_doc>
  <internal_doc ref="2023 Q3 Finance Earning Call">
Financial Statement:
- Revenue: $2.3mil
- Fixed cost: $0.5mil
- Variable cost: $1.1mil
...

You will now greet the user and prepare for copiloting with the user.

```

## Basic technique

> Note that the examples are for reference only - feel free to add/remove/modify the elements.

- Role playing vs instruction prompt
- Role playing example prompt: "You are <X>, and you will <intended interaction with user>. Your personality is <further describe attributes>. You will behave in the following ways: <behaviorial guidelines>."
- Instruction prompt example: "Based on the description provided by the user, analyze the todo tasks. Consider aspects such as category, importance, urgency etc, and help *organize* it into a concrete TODO list/action items with your analysis results and rationale."
- Instruction prompt more suitable for "objective" task, and role playing for more subjective/fuzzy tasks
- Instruction prompt can use list/point form for requirement also
- Can have both at the same time

- Zero-shots vs few-shots prompting: Just ask the AI to do something = zero-shot. Can add examples to guide the AI's behavior more strongly, i.e. few-shots (because usually a few examples in the prompt, n = 1 to 5 say, sometimes more if situation very complex and there is enough context length).
- Example (Sentiment analysis):

```md
You will receive a movie review from the user. Classify its sentiment as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Examples:
Review: As the latest series in an overmilked franchise, it has been...
Sentiment: NEGATIVE

Review: I went into the cinema having little expectations over what is supposed to be a deliberately simplistic Japanese anime. I couldn't have been more wrong.
Sentiment: POSITIVE

----
User query:
Review: An intriguing artistic conception of one particularly deep and subtle vision of the future, it is certainly not for the faint of imagination. But for those who can stomach the heavy academic requirement, it will pay off dividends handsomely.
Sentiment: 
```

- Good fit for few-shots: You have nuanced requirement on what to do that is easier to illustrate with a few example than to explain using prose/paragraph of text. Eg complicated formatting requirement.

## Intermediate Technique

- Chain of thoughts (CoT): Starting the AI's response with "Let's think step by step" is found to elicit reasoning behavior.
- LLM can only do O(1) compute for each token, if it must output answer immediately => limited thinking space/time
- In contrast, allow it to think step by step => more space/time to work on it
- Like a draft area
- Later model often have built in CoT, so less useful. BUT,
- Can incorporate the lesson learned. Eg: "You may think internally before responding to the user. To do so, write in a draft area that is indicated by surrounding it with custom XML tag named `<draft>`. They will be hidden from user." Similarly, "Consider decomposing the problems and solving them systematically, one by one."


- LLM can be asked to make **Structured Generation**. Example: "Generate a RPG character profile for a <game description>. Your output should consist of just a JSON object according to the following schema: <attach text of the JSONSchema here>"
- Use: as a glue between the AI layer and logic layer. Logic layer is ordinary computer program, so this is needed for the program to be able to get the granular data, instead of having the treat the whole text as an opaque blob.
- Example application; **Tool using** - logic layer can execute action on behalf of the AI (speech act theory). Example of tools: web search, insert item to user's todo list or calendar, run a python interperter...
- For tool using, most modern GenAI app have standardized to **OpenAI's function calling** feature. i.e. treat them as like a python function call. The prompt may provide code snippet of the python functions with just the function signature + doc-string with implementation skipped. Remember to specify the output schema.

- ReACT: May ask the LLM to engage in a thought loop/OODA loop. Original format:
```md
Thought 1: The user is asking for a question that requires access to latest info. Hence I should search the internet.
Action 1: web_search(query="recent biotech breakthrough", time=TimeRange.LAST_MONTH)
--
Observation 1:
Here are the search result:
<results>...

Thought 2: Based on the search result, it seems the science magazine, the science PhD forums, and the op-ed pieces hold important info that we should further investigate.
Action 2: read_webpage([0, 1, 3])
--
Observation 2:
Here are the webpage's summary:
<summaries>...

...
```

The `--` is used as a stop token, which the logic layer then intervene by parsing the structured output from the line `Action x:`. The text of `Observation x:` are injected by the logic layer programmatically.


# Agent

Agent differ from using LLM directly, in that agent has:
- Internal mental state that are kept track of
- Autonomous and goal-seeking behavior
- Long range planning

Agent is done by designing a special system prompt, and then running the LLM in a loop. Each time the LLM is asked to eventually make a structured output, which is parsed and processed by the logic layer. After any actions are executed and the enviornmental and internal states are updated, either part of the system prompt that act like a "dashboard" for the LLM are modified by the logic layer in-situ, or new system message is inserted to indicate events. (or both)

Usually (but not always), the backbone of an agent loop consist of instructing the agent to engage in ReACT style reasoning and action loop (see above for a refresher).

Generally speaking, agent requires a smarter LLM model. Agent excels when the tasks requires dynamically adapting to the situations at hand and even need to improvise - statically, or manually, "programming" the LLM's behavior will fail to foresee all possible variations the enviornment may throw at us.

## Cognitive Architecture

An agent's main system prompt often contains some recognizable components or modules. The way these modules are put together, like designing the AI's mind, is known as cognitive architecture.

Some common modules:
- Top level goal (given by user)
- Agent psychological profile
- Background/Enviornment description
- List of tools/actions available to the agent
- Various mental states (eg internal TODO list that the agent can update via a special tool, episodic memory through a vector database...)
- Behavioral guideline (can use few-shot prompting)

## Multi-agent

For complex problems, it might be too much to ask one single LLM to "do it all". So we can instead decompose the problem and have multiple agents, each working on one aspect of the problem. Agents can communicate to each other via a special tool that's like sending a message in a messaging app. These communication may be for delegating a task to a subagent, or for a subagent to ask for clarification. Another use case is for a group of agents to discuss and debate among themselves.

Team of agents can be socially organized in different way. Hierarchical org is suitable for tasks with clear decomposition. On the other hand, a peer to peer flat org is also possible, for instance, when we want to hear diverse perspective on a problem.

Regardless of what you do, make sure you explain clearly the setup to the agents in the system prompt/cognitive architecture.
