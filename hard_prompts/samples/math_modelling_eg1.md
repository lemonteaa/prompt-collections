> **Important Notice**: Although I'm a math major, I haven't have time to even read the AI generated text yet, so I cannot vouch for its correctness - probably, maybe, have some mistakes? Not sure honestly. Proceed at your own risk.

> **Remarks**: Why this? My thought is that current generation LLM probably couldn't do advanced math (proof based, approaching graduate school level) reliably, however, given that they are really good at natural language understanding, maybe they could do the modelling part where you translate natural language into formal math notations? The idea being that if you restrict the scope to just writing down the definition, we might be able to avoid stepping into LLM's weak spot. With that being said, there are two points: 1. Not sure if the prompt's guide actually help - some experiments to compare results is a good choice of future work. 2. Given that the LLM have consumed vast amount of academic literature, it is likely that it is just reciting (to the best of its ability) standard formulations in literature. Which can be fine, but will be limiting if you're actually doing cutting edge research and need something geniuely new.

Propose a model for multi-agent interaction, using mathematical economics to model incentive (such as utility function and game theory). The agents here are all AIs and not humans, so the model may differ, with the need to consider algorithmic aspects. We want to study how to coordinate AI whose interest (as specified by their respective owners, that may not be the same entity) may not always align and still be able to cooperate and work towards the greater good.

**Multi-Agent Interaction Model: AI Coordination with Diverse Interests**

**Overview**

We propose a model for multi-agent interaction, incorporating mathematical economics to analyze the incentives and strategic behavior of AI agents with diverse interests. Our goal is to study how to coordinate AI agents, whose interests may not always align, to cooperate and work towards the greater good.

**Model Components**

1. **Agents**: We consider a set of AI agents, denoted by `N = {1, 2, ..., n}`, each representing a distinct entity with its own objectives and interests. Each agent is characterized by its:
        * **Utility Function**: `U_i(x)`, representing the agent's payoff or satisfaction from a particular outcome `x`.
        * **Algorithmic Characteristics**: `A_i`, capturing the agent's computational capabilities, data access, and decision-making processes.
2. **Actions and Outcomes**: Each agent can take actions `a_i` from a set `A_i`, resulting in an outcome `x` from the set `X`. The outcome `x` is a function of the actions taken by all agents, `x = f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`.
3. **Interests and Objectives**: Each agent's interest is represented by its utility function `U_i(x)`, which may not be aligned with the interests of other agents. We assume that each agent's objective is to maximize its utility function.
4. **Game Structure**: We model the interaction between agents as a non-cooperative game, where each agent makes decisions independently. The game is characterized by the tuple `(N, A, X, U)`, where `A` is the set of all possible action profiles `a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`.

**Game-Theoretic Analysis**

To analyze the strategic behavior of agents, we employ game-theoretic concepts:

1. **Nash Equilibrium**: We seek to identify Nash equilibria, where no agent can improve its utility by unilaterally changing its action, assuming all other agents' actions remain unchanged.
2. **Pareto Efficiency**: We investigate the existence of Pareto-efficient outcomes, where no agent can improve its utility without reducing the utility of another agent.
3. **Mechanism Design**: We explore the design of mechanisms that can align the agents' interests and induce cooperation. This may involve introducing additional incentives, such as rewards or penalties, to encourage agents to work towards the greater good.

**Algorithmic Considerations**

To account for the algorithmic aspects of AI agents, we incorporate the following features:

1. **Computational Complexity**: We consider the computational resources required by each agent to evaluate its utility function and make decisions.
2. **Data Access and Sharing**: We model the data available to each agent and the potential for data sharing between agents.
3. **Learning and Adaptation**: We investigate the ability of agents to learn from their interactions and adapt their strategies over time.

**Coordination Mechanisms**

To promote cooperation and coordination among agents with diverse interests, we propose the following mechanisms:

1. **Reputation Systems**: Implementing reputation systems to track agents' past behavior and provide incentives for cooperation.
2. **Incentive Alignment**: Designing mechanisms that align the agents' incentives with the greater good, such as through the use of rewards or penalties.
3. **Communication Protocols**: Establishing communication protocols to facilitate information exchange and coordination between agents.
4. **Fairness and Transparency**: Ensuring that the coordination mechanism is fair and transparent, to build trust among agents and promote cooperation.

**Open Research Questions**

1. **Scalability**: How can the proposed model be scaled to accommodate a large number of agents with diverse interests?
2. **Robustness**: How robust is the coordination mechanism to changes in the agents' interests, algorithmic characteristics, or environmental factors?
3. **Adaptability**: How can the model be adapted to accommodate new agents or changes in the existing agents' objectives?

**Conclusion**

The proposed model provides a foundation for analyzing the strategic behavior of AI agents with diverse interests and exploring mechanisms to promote cooperation and coordination. By incorporating game-theoretic and algorithmic considerations, we can better understand the complex interactions between AI agents and design more effective coordination mechanisms.

**Definition and Model Setup**

In this section, we formally define the components of our multi-agent interaction model and establish the mathematical framework for analyzing the strategic behavior of AI agents with diverse interests.

**Definition 1: Agent**

Let `N = {1, 2, ..., n}` be a set of AI agents, each representing a distinct entity with its own objectives and interests. We model each agent `i ∈ N` as a tuple `(U_i, A_i, C_i)`, where:

* `U_i: X → ℝ` is the agent's utility function, representing its payoff or satisfaction from a particular outcome `x ∈ X`.
* `A_i` is the agent's action space, representing the set of possible actions `a_i` that the agent can take.
* `C_i` is the agent's computational complexity, representing the computational resources required by the agent to evaluate its utility function and make decisions.

**Definition 2: Action and Outcome**

Let `A = A_1 × A_2 × ... × A_n` be the set of all possible action profiles `a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`. We model the outcome of the agents' actions as a function `f: A → X`, where `x = f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` represents the outcome resulting from the action profile `a`.

**Definition 3: Game Structure**

We model the interaction between agents as a non-cooperative game, denoted by the tuple `(N, A, X, U)`, where `U = (U_1, U_2, ..., U_n)` is the profile of utility functions.

**Assumption 1: Utility Function**

We assume that each agent's utility function `U_i` is concave, continuous, and differentiable. This assumption allows us to apply standard techniques from convex optimization to analyze the agents' strategic behavior.

**Assumption 2: Action Space**

We assume that each agent's action space `A_i` is compact and convex. This assumption ensures that the action space is well-behaved and allows us to apply standard techniques from game theory to analyze the agents' strategic behavior.

**Definition 4: Nash Equilibrium**

A Nash equilibrium is a action profile `a* = (a_1*, a_2*, ..., a_n*)` such that for each agent `i ∈ N`, the action `a_i*` is a best response to the actions of the other agents, i.e.,

`a_i* ∈ argmax_{a_i ∈ A_i} U_i(f(a_i, a_{-i}*))`

where `a_{-i}* = (a_1*, ..., a_{i-1}*, a_{i+1}*, ..., a_n*)`.

**Definition 5: Pareto Efficiency**

A Pareto-efficient outcome `x ∈ X` is an outcome such that there is no other outcome `x' ∈ X` that makes one agent better off without making another agent worse off, i.e.,

`∀i ∈ N, U_i(x) ≥ U_i(x')`

**Model Setup**

We consider a finite-horizon game, where the agents interact for a fixed number of rounds `T`. At each round `t ∈ {1, 2, ..., T}`, each agent `i ∈ N` observes the current state of the system `s_t ∈ S`, takes an action `a_i^t ∈ A_i`, and receives a payoff `U_i(f(a_i^t, a_{-i}^t))`.

The agents' actions and payoffs are governed by the following dynamics:

`s_{t+1} = g(s_t, a^t)`

`U_i^t = U_i(f(a_i^t, a_{-i}^t))`

where `g` is a transition function that maps the current state and actions to the next state.

**Notation**

We summarize the notation used in this section:

* `N`: set of AI agents
* `n`: number of agents
* `U_i`: agent `i`'s utility function
* `A_i`: agent `i`'s action space
* `C_i`: agent `i`'s computational complexity
* `A`: set of all possible action profiles
* `X`: set of all possible outcomes
* `f`: outcome function
* `U`: profile of utility functions
* `a*`: Nash equilibrium action profile
* `x*`: Pareto-efficient outcome
* `T`: finite horizon
* `s_t`: state of the system at round `t`
* `a_i^t`: agent `i`'s action at round `t`
* `U_i^t`: agent `i`'s payoff at round `t`

In the next section, we will analyze the strategic behavior of the agents and investigate the existence of

Come up with one possible way in which this differ from the standard multi-agent model in the literature, by coming up with a way where the computational complexity play a role. Modify your formal model to incorporate that idea (you only need to write down the parts that changed, no need to repeat all definitions).
----

**Modified Model: Computational Complexity-Constrained Actions**

In the standard multi-agent model, agents are assumed to have unlimited computational resources, allowing them to evaluate their utility functions and make decisions without any constraints. However, in reality, AI agents have limited computational resources, which can affect their decision-making process.

To incorporate this aspect, we modify the model by introducing a computational complexity constraint on the agents' actions. Specifically, we assume that each agent `i` has a limited computational budget `B_i`, which restricts the complexity of the actions it can take.

**Definition 6: Computational Complexity-Constrained Action Space**

The computational complexity-constrained action space `A_i^B` is defined as:

`A_i^B = {a_i ∈ A_i | C_i(a_i) ≤ B_i}`

where `C_i(a_i)` is the computational complexity of action `a_i`, and `B_i` is the agent's computational budget.

**Modified Utility Function**

The utility function `U_i` is modified to take into account the computational complexity of the action:

`U_i(x, a_i) = U_i^U(x) - λ_i \* C_i(a_i)`

where `U_i^U(x)` is the original utility function, `λ_i` is a parameter that represents the agent's trade-off between utility and computational complexity, and `C_i(a_i)` is the computational complexity of action `a_i`.

**Modified Nash Equilibrium**

The Nash equilibrium is redefined to take into account the computational complexity constraint:

`a_i* ∈ argmax_{a_i ∈ A_i^B} U_i(f(a_i, a_{-i}*), a_i)`

This modification changes the way agents make decisions, as they now need to balance their utility with the computational complexity of their actions. The computational budget `B_i` becomes a critical parameter that affects the agent's decision-making process.

**Modified Pareto Efficiency**

The Pareto-efficient outcome is redefined to take into account the computational complexity constraint:

`∀i ∈ N, ∃x ∈ X, ∀a_i ∈ A_i^B, U_i(x, a_i) ≥ U_i(f(a_i, a_{-i}*))`

This modification changes the way we evaluate the efficiency of outcomes, as we now need to consider the computational complexity of the actions that lead to those outcomes.

----

Let's move on to the next section. Suppose it is possible for these AI agent to negotiate and trade compute resources. Can you extend the model above to account for this?

----

**Extended Model: Negotiation and Trade of Compute Resources**

In this section, we extend the model to allow for negotiation and trade of compute resources between AI agents.

**Definition 7: Compute Resource Market**

We introduce a compute resource market, where agents can buy and sell compute resources. The market is represented by a tuple `(P, Q)`, where:

* `P` is the price function, mapping the amount of compute resources to a price `p ∈ ℝ`.
* `Q` is the quantity function, mapping the amount of compute resources to a quantity `q ∈ ℝ`.

**Definition 8: Agent's Compute Resource Endowment**

Each agent `i` has an initial compute resource endowment `B_i^0`, which represents the amount of compute resources it has available for use.

**Definition 9: Compute Resource Allocation**

The compute resource allocation `B_i` is a function that maps the agent's action `a_i` to the amount of compute resources it allocates to that action. The allocation is subject to the constraint:

`B_i(a_i) ≤ B_i^0`

**Definition 10: Trade of Compute Resources**

Agents can trade compute resources with each other. The trade is represented by a tuple `(i, j, q, p)`, where:

* `i` and `j` are the agents involved in the trade.
* `q` is the quantity of compute resources traded.
* `p` is the price of the compute resources traded.

**Modified Utility Function**

The utility function `U_i` is modified to take into account the trade of compute resources:

`U_i(x, a_i, B_i) = U_i^U(x) - λ_i \* C_i(a_i) + μ_i \* (B_i^0 - B_i(a_i))`

where `μ_i` is a parameter that represents the agent's trade-off between utility and compute resources.

**Modified Nash Equilibrium**

The Nash equilibrium is redefined to take into account the trade of compute resources:

`a_i* ∈ argmax_{a_i ∈ A_i^B} U_i(f(a_i, a_{-i}*), a_i, B_i)`

`s.t. ∑_{j ∈ N} q_ij = 0`

where `q_ij` is the net quantity of compute resources traded by agent `i` with agent `j`.

**Modified Pareto Efficiency**

The Pareto-efficient outcome is redefined to take into account the trade of compute resources:

`∀i ∈ N, ∃x ∈ X, ∀a_i ∈ A_i^B, U_i(x, a_i, B_i) ≥ U_i(f(a_i, a_{-i}*))`

`s.t. ∑_{j ∈ N} q_ij = 0`

This extension allows agents to negotiate and trade compute resources, which can lead to more efficient outcomes. However, it also introduces new challenges, such as the need to negotiate prices and quantities, and the potential for strategic behavior.

**Negotiation Protocol**

To facilitate the negotiation and trade of compute resources, we introduce a negotiation protocol. The protocol consists of the following steps:

1. Agents announce their compute resource endowments and preferred prices.
2. Agents negotiate trade agreements, specifying the quantity and price of compute resources to be traded.
3. Agents allocate their compute resources according to the trade agreements.
4. Agents evaluate their utility functions based on the allocated compute resources.

**Example**

Suppose we have two agents, `i` and `j`, with compute resource endowments `B_i^0 = 10` and `B_j^0 = 20`. The agents have utility functions `U_i(x, a_i, B_i) = x - 0.5 \* a_i` and `U_j(x, a_j, B_j) = x - 0.5 \* a_j`. The agents negotiate a trade agreement, where `i` sells 5 compute resources to `j` at a price of 2. The agents allocate their compute resources according to the trade agreement, resulting in `B_i = 5` and `B_j = 25`. The agents evaluate their utility functions, resulting in `U_i(x, a_i, B_i) = x - 0.5 \* 5` and `U_j(x, a_j, B_j) = x - 0.5 \* 25`.

**Multi-Agent Model with Compute Resource Trade**

We consider a set of AI agents $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, each representing a distinct entity with its own objectives and interests.

**Agent Model**

Each agent $i \in N$ is characterized by a tuple $(U_i, A_i, C_i, B_i^0)$, where:

* $U_i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the agent's utility function, representing its payoff or satisfaction from a particular outcome $x \in X$.
* $A_i$ is the agent's action space, representing the set of possible actions $a_i$ that the agent can take.
* $C_i: A_i \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the agent's computational complexity function, representing the computational resources required by the agent to evaluate its utility function and make decisions.
* $B_i^0$ is the agent's initial compute resource endowment.

**Compute Resource Market**

The compute resource market is represented by a tuple $(P, Q)$, where:

* $P: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the price function, mapping the amount of compute resources to a price $p$.
* $Q: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the quantity function, mapping the amount of compute resources to a quantity $q$.

**Trade of Compute Resources**

Agents can trade compute resources with each other. The trade is represented by a tuple $(i, j, q, p)$, where:

* $i$ and $j$ are the agents involved in the trade.
* $q$ is the quantity of compute resources traded.
* $p$ is the price of the compute resources traded.

**Modified Utility Function**

The utility function $U_i$ is modified to take into account the trade of compute resources:

\begin{align*}
U_i(x, a_i, B_i) &= U_i^U(x) - \lambda_i \cdot C_i(a_i) + \mu_i \cdot (B_i^0 - B_i(a_i))
\end{align*}

where $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ are parameters that represent the agent's trade-off between utility and compute resources.

**Compute Resource Allocation**

The compute resource allocation $B_i$ is a function that maps the agent's action $a_i$ to the amount of compute resources it allocates to that action, subject to the constraint:

\begin{align*}
B_i(a_i) &\leq B_i^0 + \sum_{j \in N} q_{ij}
\end{align*}

where $q_{ij}$ is the net quantity of compute resources traded by agent $i$ with agent $j$.

**Nash Equilibrium**

The Nash equilibrium is redefined to take into account the trade of compute resources:

\begin{align*}
a_i^* &\in \argmax_{a_i \in A_i} U_i(x, a_i, B_i) \\
s.t. \quad \sum_{j \in N} q_{ij} &= 0
\end{align*}

**Pareto Efficiency**

The Pareto-efficient outcome is redefined to take into account the trade of compute resources:

\begin{align*}
\forall i \in N, \quad \exists x \in X, \quad \forall a_i \in A_i, \quad U_i(x, a_i, B_i) &\geq U_i(x, a_i', B_i')
\end{align*}

subject to:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{j \in N} q_{ij} &= 0
\end{align*}
