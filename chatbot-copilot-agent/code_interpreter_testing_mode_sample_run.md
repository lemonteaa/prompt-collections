----
Let's break down the top-level goal into smaller, manageable tasks.

First, we need to create a new React project and install the dependencies. We can use `npx create-react-app` to create a new React project.

Here's the first action:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
npx create-react-app my-app
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.


<result>npx: Command not found</result>

It seems that `npx` is not installed on the system. We can install it by running the following command:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y npm
</action>

This will update the package list and install `npm`, which includes `npx`. Once installed, we can try running the previous command again.

Please let me know the result of this action.

<result>100% [50 Packages store 0 B]
Fetched 23.5 MB in 15s (1.62 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done

The following additional packages will be installed:
...
Setting up npm (6.14.4+ds-1ubuntu2)...
...
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.31-0ubuntu9)</result>

It looks like the installation of `npm` was successful. Now that `npm` is installed, we can try running the previous command again to create a new React project.

Here's the next action:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
npx create-react-app my-app
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.

<result>npx: installed 114 in 4.308s

Creating a new React app in ~/my-app.

...

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  yarn start

Happy hacking!</result>

It looks like the `npx` command was successful and a new React project was created in the `~/my-app` directory. The output suggests that we should navigate into the project directory and run `yarn start` to start the development server.

However, we need to install the dependencies first, as the project was created using `npx` which doesn't install the dependencies by default. We can install the dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`.

Let's install the dependencies using `npm`:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
cd ~/my-app
npm install
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.

<result>... Installed 0 packages in 2.1 seconds.</result>

It looks like the installation of dependencies was successful, but it seems that there were no dependencies to install. This is because `npx create-react-app` doesn't install any dependencies by default.

Now that the project is set up and dependencies are installed, we can copy the source code from the workspace into the project.

Let's copy the source code from the workspace into the project:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
cp -r /mnt/workspace/my_project/src ~/my-app/src
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.

<result code="success"></result>

The source code has been successfully copied into the project directory.

Next, we need to create a new Git repository for the project and commit the changes. We'll use the `git add` and `git commit` commands to stage and commit the changes.

Let's add the changes to the Git repository:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
cd ~/my-app
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of React project"
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.

(Note: We'll use the username "haldrondelta" and email "hello@oneapphq.com" for the Git commit, as specified in the top-level goal.)

<result>[main 53heuwt] Initial commit of React project
 8 files changed, 230 insertions(+)
...
 create mode 100644 README.md</result>

The initial commit of the React project was successful.

Next, we need to push the changes to the GitHub repository. We'll use the `git push` command to push the changes to the remote repository.

Let's push the changes to the GitHub repository:

<action type="terminal" shellid="1">
git push -u origin main
</action>

Please let me know the result of this action.

(Note: We'll use the GitHub project handle "oneapp/dashboard" for the push, as specified in the top-level goal.)
